Feature extraction experiment for long short-term memory network for financial time series prediction

A few methods for feature extraction:
  - Stacked auto-encoders
  - Convolutional neural networks
  
The purpose of this experiment is too see if the performance of the LSTM can be improved with feature extraction.
